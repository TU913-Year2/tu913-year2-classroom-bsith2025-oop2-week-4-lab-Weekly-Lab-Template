# oop2labPerfectNumbers
This lab exercise has four objectives:
- To get you started using git and github
- To get you started using the Command Line Interface
- To guide you through a Top Down Design solution to a problem
- To get you to correctly translate pseudo-code

This programme imports the Account attribute and then implements it as
two separate instances, one for Jane Doe and one for John Doe

Clone the repository and make a local copy to work on.
Rewrite the Account class so that the code for each of the gets and sets works perfectly.
Implement the class using the runBank.py program.
Alter the reunBank program so that it 
1) Prints the details of each account set up
2) allows you to make a withdrawal from any account
3) update the balance of the account when a withdrawal is made(ensure that you can't make an overdraft)
